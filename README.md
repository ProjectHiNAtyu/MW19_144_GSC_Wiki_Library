# MW19_144_GSC_Wiki_Library

[ About ]


The GSCBIN Dump, GSC Injector, and GSC Dumper are based on the GSC Injection process devised by Mr. Sku-111 in Project Donetsk, which we have reconstructed and utilized.

I express my heartfelt respect and gratitude to Mr. Sku-111, who devised and implemented this injection process.

Additionally, the GSC Source is based on Mr. xensik's gsc-tool and has been decompiled.

Thank you always, and I support you.

< GSC Loader >


For detailed operation instructions, You can read it by pressing various buttons after launching the Loader application.
Or read the included readme.txt

< gsc-tool >

This app is a command-line tool operated via cmd.

HiNAtyu does not accept questions regarding the tool.

Please direct your questions to xensik.

Please download and use the latest version of the release file for gsc-tool from xensik's official repository.

If there is demand in the future, I may rework the gsc-tool for the 1.38 build, but for now I guarantee it will work with the official version of gsc-tool.
